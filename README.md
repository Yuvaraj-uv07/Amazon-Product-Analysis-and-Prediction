## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

In today‚Äôs digital world, data is the new oil ‚Äî especially in the e-commerce space. Platforms like **Amazon** generate vast amounts of product and customer data that can offer critical insights into **market behavior**, **pricing strategies**, and **consumer preferences**.

This project demonstrates how to extract and analyze Amazon product data using tools like **Selenium**, **BeautifulSoup**, **Pandas**, and **Power BI**, and further applies **machine learning** models for **price prediction** and **Prime product classification**.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Objectives

- Scrape product data from Amazon search pages  
- Collect key attributes: title, price, rating, review count, etc.  
- Clean and preprocess data  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Extract actionable business insights  
- Apply regression models to predict product price  
- Apply classification models to predict Prime eligibility  

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Tools and Technologies

- **Python** ‚Äì Core language for scraping, analysis, and modeling  
- **Selenium** ‚Äì Browser automation for dynamic content  
- **BeautifulSoup** ‚Äì HTML parsing and data extraction  
- **Pandas & NumPy** ‚Äì Data manipulation and wrangling  
- **MySQL/SSMS** ‚Äì Database storage and connectivity  
- **Scikit-learn** ‚Äì Machine learning models  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** ‚Äì Visualizations during EDA  
- **Power BI** ‚Äì Interactive dashboards  
- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì Development and analysis environment

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection Methodology

- Launch headless Chrome browser using Selenium  
- Navigate Amazon search result pages with specific keywords  
- Extract product titles, prices, ratings, and review counts  
- Handle pagination to scrape multiple pages  
- Store the scraped data into a structured DataFrame  

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Handle missing or null values  
- Convert strings to numeric data types (price, rating, reviews)  
- Remove duplicates and outliers  
- Normalize column formats  
- Prepare clean dataset for analysis and modeling  

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis

Visual insights include:

- **Price Distribution**: Most products fall into mid-range prices  
- **Rating Distribution**: Majority of products have ratings between 3.5 to 4.5  
- **Popularity Analysis**: High review counts usually signal top products  
- **Category Breakdown**: Fashion accessories dominate (Men, Women, Kids)

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Key Insights

- Moderately priced products often have better ratings  
- High review counts are typically associated with well-known brands  
- No strong correlation between price and rating ‚Äî buyers prioritize quality and usability  
- Women‚Äôs accessories are the most diverse and popular segment  

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Integration

- Cleaned data is stored in **MySQL** using `mysql-connector`  
- Table schema includes: Category, Brand, Product Name, Price, Rating, Discount, Availability, Product URL, Date  
- Supports seamless integration with Power BI and SQL-based analytics  

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard in Power BI

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize and explore:

- Average prices and rating distribution  
- Discount percentages  
- Availability and product segments  
- Drilldown filters: Category, Brand, Price Range  

> üí° Connects directly to MySQL for real-time data refresh.

---

## üîü Machine Learning

### üìà Price Prediction  
- **Multiple Linear Regression** as baseline  
- Enhanced using:
  - **Ridge Regression (L2)**  
  - **Lasso Regression (L1)**  
  - **ElasticNet (L1 + L2)**  

### ‚úÖ Prime Classification  
- Models Used:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Decision Tree**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **XGBoost**

> Ensemble models provided the best classification results for Prime eligibility.
